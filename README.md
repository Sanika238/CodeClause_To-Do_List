To-Do List using HTML CSS JS

Description-
A To-do list won't just be useful for you. It can also introduce you to the basics of form submission and data saving.
We can record the tasks to be done in a list format, that can be ticked off upon completion.
We can even edit, as well as delete an existing task.
The tasks are categorized according to preferences as 'personal' and 'business' to make things simpler.
